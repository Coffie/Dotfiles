ncurses is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because macOS already provides this software and installing another version in
parallel can cause all kinds of trouble.

If you need to have ncurses first in your PATH run:
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/ncurses/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

For compilers to find ncurses you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/ncurses/lib"

==> Caveats
file-formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because macOS already provides this software and installing another version in
parallel can cause all kinds of trouble.

If you need to have file-formula first in your PATH run:
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/file-formula/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

==> Caveats
apr is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because Apple's CLT provides apr.

If you need to have apr first in your PATH run:
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/apr/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

==> Caveats
apr-util is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,

unzip is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because macOS already provides this software and installing another version in
